# Olympics-Data-Analysis-Project
Project Overview

The Olympics Data Analysis Project focuses on uncovering historical trends and making predictions based on previous Olympic Games data. The goal is to deliver actionable insights into country performance, athlete statistics, and medal outcomes using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess historical Olympics data for accurate analysis.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

Build machine learning models to predict medal outcomes.

Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handled missing and inconsistent data to ensure dataset reliability.

Created relevant features for predictive modeling, such as athlete age groups and event types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized trends in medal counts, country performance, and athlete participation over time.

Analyzed the correlation between GDP, population, and medal counts.

3. Predictive Modeling

Built machine learning models using Scikit-learn to predict medal outcomes.

Evaluated models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights

Identified top-performing countries and their consistent trends over decades.

Highlighted the growing prominence of new countries in specific sports categories.

Showed the relationship between economic indicators and Olympic success.

Future Work

Incorporate additional external datasets (e.g., weather or economic data) to enhance predictions.

Explore deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

Develop a dynamic dashboard for real-time analys
